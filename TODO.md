# Future Roadmap

last updated: 19 june 2025

## functionalities
1. optimise zen mode (one menu for all: change instruments etc)
2. customise key bindings & overhaul states.ts
3. show changelog if isFirstVisitAfterUpdate
4. do something about record function. maybe shift it inside transcription menu?
5. firebase auth & leaderboard (try google auth?)
6. figure out a usage for water. e.g. reward system?

## audio
1. sample virtual singers? (legality check)
2. sample more otto
3. option to play two or more instruments at once: this should be manageable in tone but i need to overhaul instrueffect.ts

### final boss: sustain (dev w. specy)

## visual
1. fix lights
2. UI improvements & better buttons on visual guide
3. note animation (see mcbeeringi)
4. background customisation (maybe in tandem with water reward system)

## transcription
1. fix sheet transcription issues (notes cut short, accidentals not stopping after un-shifting)

## optimisation
1. move keypress event handlers outside keypress.ts into their individual component files
2. fix phone optimisation & touch support (disable pinchzoom) and fix sizing issues on small viewport
3. preload / cache image for character


## completed
* zen mode
