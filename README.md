# Functionality & Features
### inspired by the sky: CoTL musical keyboard
#### play music. yes. you can legitimately play music on this

1. play with both halves of your keyboard
2. switch to different keyboard modes: toggle with `Backspace`
3. transpose to a different key: top row number keys (``` `1234567890-= ```)
4. shift up and down octaves: arrow keys (`ArrowUp`, `ArrowDown`, `ArrowLeft`, `ArrowRight`)
5. play accidentals: `Shift` for both sides, left or right `Alt` for either side
6. control the "sustain pedal": `Caps Lock`
7. view statistics on amount of time spent & no. of notes played
8. control the volume: menu
9. change instruments to different ones (from Sky: CoTL) or synths: menu
10. add effects to instrument (e.g. distortion) which you can adjust: menu
11. record and save your melodies: menu
12. you can turn the lights off (?): `\`
13. water collection feature (reward TBC)
14. transposing by one semitone: `[` for down, `]` for up
15. see a skykid play instruments. currently supported: `piano, guitar, flute, horn, harp`
16. transcribe, share & import sheets. only skysynth sheets can be imported to skysynth for now

just press random keys to get started. it can be a lot of fun !
(especially if you're familiar with the Sky: CoTL music keyboard like i am)
